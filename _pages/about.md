I am a first-year PhD student at Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering, Princeton University. My research interests broadly lie in mathematical optimization and its related applications. I am interested in developing optimization algorithms that are robust in both theory and practical implementation.
Prior to Princeton, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Mathematics from the Australian National University, where I was very fortunated to be advised by Prof. [Qinian Jin](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/jin-q) and work with Prof. [Lindon Roberts](https://lindonroberts.github.io/).
